\titledquestion{Mystery Language}

  Is the following language regular or not? Provide a proof to justify your claim.
  \[
    L = \{ w^iw^j \mid w\in\{0,1\}^*, 0 < i \leq j \}
  \]
  
  \begin{solution}
    \textbf{To check whether the Language is Regular or not, I will use Pumping lemma.}
    \\ \textbf{Pumping Lemma:}
    \\ Let W = $1^n$
    \\ We know that $|xy| < n$ so y will contain all the strings of 's
    \\ Thus in this case it would be \{ w^iw^j\} = $(1^n)^i$ $(1^n)^j$
    \\ From the question we can determine that i can be less than or equal to j so taking i = 1 and j =2
    
    \\ Pumping up for 2 times =  $(1^n)^(i+2)$ $(1^n)^j$
    \\ This would end up as 11111
    \\ \textbf{We dont know the mid point so we can determine what is first part of w which is with i and what is second part of w which is with j }
    
    \\ we observe that pumping or pumping down will only cause change in the first part of string, keeping the other one unchanged
    \\ we can say that the resulted string is same and and following all the rules so the language is regular
    
    \\ \textbf{And we know that if resulting string on language is String is regular then the language itself is also regular}
  \end{solution}
